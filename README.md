# Plot Residuals

This repository contains scripts for obtaining residual values generated in Ansys Fluent simulations through transcription files that are automatically generated throughout the simulations.

----

* The ```main.py``` contains the whole script that:

    1. Read a ```.trn``` file
    2. Extract the residual name
    3. Extract the residual values, line by line
    4. Save all into a ```Pandas.DataFrame```
    5. Plot all residuais using the ```Plotly``` package


* The ```data``` folder is used to storage the ```.trn``` files that are generated by simulations
